This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Screen shoots were added I added screenshots outside of the redo directory. 

## If you don't have Node.js 
You would need to install Node.js and create-react-app in order to run this application.</br>
To install create react app you will have to create a new directory inside of the terminal and run the command npm install create-react-app. As result you should see the application be installed in your system.<br>
 Change the directory to the cortex, then 
 1. run the command ls to list all the directories 
 2. cd(change directory) to redo and then inside of redo 
 3. run pwd to make sure that you are working in the right directory 4. finally, run npm start to run the project.

I have provided links for creating React app and Node.js installments
